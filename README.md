# Autonomous-exploration

In this work two methods for autonomous exploration are presented, both based on the frontier method by maximizing some sort of cost/reward function. One is based on minimizing
the cost of the steps the robot has to take to reach the goal, and the other focuses on estimating traffic zones (like doors that open to new spaces) that could yield more valuable
information over, say, free areas on the map. The aim of this report is to explain how these methods work exactly, as well as show important improvements on the replanning of the robot
and the estimation of the normal to the frontier. Finally, results will be compared to the ones obtained in the last practice for biggest and closest frontiers.

The results of the 2 methods can be seen in the following links:
